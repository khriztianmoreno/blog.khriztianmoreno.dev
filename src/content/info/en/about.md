## About the Author üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

Hello! I'm **Cristian Moreno**, a **Senior Software Engineer** with experience building frontend and backend applications using modern technologies like [JavaScript](/en/tags/javascript), **TypeScript**, [React](/en/tags/react), and [Node.js](/en/tags/nodejs). I love creating robust and scalable web experiences, focusing on clean code and effective solutions.

My focus areas are:

- **Frontend**: Dynamic interfaces with React and TypeScript.
- **Backend**: Scalable microservices and APIs using Node.js and Rest/GraphQL.
- **Collaboration**: Mentoring teams and sharing knowledge to grow together.

I also enjoy sharing technical content and collaborating on innovative projects that make a difference.

## About the Blog

Here you will find articles, tutorials and guides about **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js** and many other technologies that we use every day as developers. My mission is to share knowledge in a clear and practical way, helping others to solve problems, learn new things and grow professionally.

This blog is born from my passion for programming and the desire to contribute to the community that has helped me so much. Sharing what I know not only allows me to give back, but also to learn and continuously improve.

If you are looking for clear solutions, useful tricks or just inspiration for your next project, you are in the right place, let's learn together!

The blog is mainly built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [React](https://react.dev/) components. I chose Astro because it is super fast. The color scheme is inspired by [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/). I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) for typography. And I do some animations with [Motion](https://motion.dev) (the original Framer Motion).

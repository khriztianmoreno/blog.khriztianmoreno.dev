Remember WebContainers? It‚Äôs the WebAssembly-based ‚Äúmicrooperating system‚Äù that can run Vite operations and the entire Node.js ecosystem in the browser. The StackBlitz team built WebContainers to power their in-browser IDE, but it often felt like the technology was still searching for a killer use case‚Äîuntil now. That‚Äôs because StackBlitz just released [bolt.new](https://bolt.new/), an AI-powered development sandbox that Eric Simons described during ViteConf as ‚Äúlike if Claude or ChatGPT had a baby with StackBlitz.‚Äù

I‚Äôll try not to imagine it too vividly, but based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews so far, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs working ‚Äì dozens of developers [describe it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1b3ZkNTSq4&ab_channel=RasMic) as a combination of v0, Claude, Cursor, and Replit. How Bolt is different: Existing AI code tools can often run some basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS in the browser, but for more complex projects, you need to copy and paste the code to a local environment. But not Bolt. By using WebContainers, you can request, run, edit, and deploy entire web applications, all from the browser. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:

- You can ask [bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) to build a production-ready multi-page app with a specific backend and database, using any technology stack you want (e.g. ‚ÄúBuild a personal blog using Astro, Tailwind, and shadcn‚Äù).
- Unlike other tools, Bolt can install and run relevant npm packages and libraries, interact with third-party APIs, and run Node servers.
- You can manually edit the code it generates via an in-browser editor, or have Bolt [resolve errors for you](https://x.com/stackblitz/status/1841873255961153804) . This is unique to Bolt, because it integrates AI into all levels of WebContainers (not just the CodeGen step).
- You can deploy to production from chat via Netlify, no login required.

There‚Äôs a lot more we could go over here, but Eric‚Äôs demo is pretty wild. In closing: From the outside, it wasn‚Äôt always clear whether StackBlitz would ever see a significant return on investment over the 5+ years they‚Äôve spent developing WebContainers. But suddenly it looks like they might be uniquely positioned to help developers leverage AI to build legitimate FullStack applications.

I hope this has been helpful and/or taught you something new!

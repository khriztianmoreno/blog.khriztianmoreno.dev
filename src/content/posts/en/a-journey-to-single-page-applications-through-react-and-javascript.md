Last June, I had the opportunity to share again in person with the [medellinjs](https://medellinjs.org/) community, which I appreciate very much.

This time, I was talking about the javascript concepts that are necessary to understand and know before facing working with a Single Page Application (SPA).

I hope this was helpful and/or taught you something new!

Cloning an object in JavaScript means creating an identical copy of an existing object. This means that the new object will have the same values ​​for each property, but it will be a different object.

## Why is it important to clone an object in javascript?

Cloning an object in javascript is important to preserve the original state of an object and prevent the propagation of changes. This is especially useful when there are multiple instances of an object that are shared between various parts of the application. Cloning the original object ensures that the other instances are not affected by changes made to the original object. This also allows developers to use a single instance of the object and create a unique copy for each part of the application. This avoids having to create a new instance of the object every time, saving time and resources.

### How to clone an object?

To clone a JavaScript object correctly, you have 4 different options:

1. Use the `structuredClone()` function
2. Use the spread operator
3. Call the `Object.assign()` function
4. Use JSON parsing.

```javascript
const data = { name: "khriztianmoreno", age: 33 };
// 1
const copy4 = structuredClone(data);
// 2
const copy1 = { ...data };
// 3
const copy2 = Object.assign({}, data);
// 4
const copy3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data));
```

### 1. `structuredClone()`

Creates a deep clone of a given value using the structured cloning algorithm.

```javascript
const original = {
  someProp: "with a string value",
  anotherProp: {
    withAnotherProp: 1,
    andAnotherProp: true,
  },
};

const myDeepCopy = structuredClone(original);
```

### 2. spread operator

The spread operator `(...)` allows you to spread an object or array into a list of individual elements, and is used to create a copy of an object.

```javascript
const original = { name: "khriztianmoreno", age: 33 };
const clone = { ...original };
```

In the above example, a new clone object is being created from the values ​​of the original object, it is important to note that this only makes a **shallow copy**, if the original object contains objects or arrays within it, these will not be cloned but the reference of the original object will be assigned.

It can also be used to clone arrays as follows:

```javascript
const original = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const clone = [...original];
```

### 3. `Object.assign`

The `Object.assign()` function is another way to clone objects in JavaScript. The function takes a target object as its first argument, and one or more source objects as additional arguments. It copies enumerable properties from the source objects to the target object.

```javascript
const original = { name: "khriztianmoreno", age: 33 };
const clone = Object.assign({}, original);
```

### 4. JSON parsing

The `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` methods are another way to clone objects in JavaScript. The `JSON.stringify()` method converts an object into a JSON string, while the `JSON.parse()` method converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object.

```javascript
const original = { name: "khriztianmoreno", age: 33 };
const clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
```

## Conclusions

### Advantages of cloning an object in javascript

1. Object cloning allows the developer to create a copy of an existing object without having to redefine all the values ​​of the object. This means that the developer can save time and effort by not having to recreate an object from scratch.

2. Object cloning also allows the developer to create a modified version of an existing object. For example, a developer can modify the values ​​of an existing object to create a customized version. This is useful in saving time by not having to rewrite the code to create an object from scratch.

3. Object cloning also allows the developer to create an improved version of an existing object. For example, a developer can add new properties to an existing object to improve its functionality.

4. Object cloning also offers a way to backup objects. This means that if the existing object is affected by a software failure, the developer can resort to the backup to recover the original values.

### Disadvantages of cloning an object in javascript

Cloning an object in Javascript can be a useful task, but there are also some drawbacks that need to be considered. The first is the execution time. Cloning objects in Javascript can be a slow process, especially if the object is large. This can lead to a poor user experience if you are trying to clone an object while running an application.

Another disadvantage of cloning objects in Javascript is that you cannot clone complex objects. This means that objects that contain references to other objects cannot be cloned properly. This can be a problem if you are trying to clone an object that contains references to other important objects, as the clone will not have these references.

Lastly, cloning objects in Javascript can also lead to security issues if you clone objects that contain sensitive information. The clone can contain the same information as the original object, which can be a security risk if you share the clone with other users.

That's all folks! I hope this article helps you understand the different options we have when it comes to cloning an object/array in javascript.

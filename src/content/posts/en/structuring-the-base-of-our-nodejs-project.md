The idea of writing this article came from a need that arose at a [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NodeJS-Medellin) in the city I attended. Many of the people there were asking how they would know where the files that make up their project should be, such as: _models, events, controllers, views, etc._ Since in Node.JS there was no base way to do it and many of the visible examples never substantiated the reason why it was built that way.

That is why I decided to create a simple base project that allows me to have local authentication using [Passport.JS](http://passportjs.org/) persisting the data in a NoSQL database like MongoDB, through [Mongoose.JS](http://mongoosejs.com/), it also uses JWT and exposes an API that could be easily extended.

This project was accompanied by a talk that I shared at the meetup [\*Test with AVA and Structuring the base of our project](https://www.meetup.com/NodeJS-Medellin/events/243518840) where I explained the step-by-step process of how to **Structure a NodeJS Project with ExpressJS for an API**, here is the link to the project [https://github.com/khriztianmoreno/nodejs-scaffolding](https://github.com/khriztianmoreno/nodejs-scaffolding) and you are invited to generate pull requests, create issues and improve this project as a community.

Here is the step-by-step guide on how to build the project that can be used to replicate it in your future projects. [Gist](https://gist.github.com/khriztianmoreno/51891107b240fbd61c3c3fd725a6bf4a)

## The Problem with Traditional Package Managers

For years, `npm` has been the de facto package manager for Node.js. While it offers robust features like private package access and two-factor authentication, it also comes with some drawbacks:

- Slow installation speeds: npm can be notoriously slow, especially for large projects.
- Bloated node_modules directories: These directories can consume significant disk space.
- Complex configuration: npm's configuration can be intricate and challenging to master.

To address these issues, alternative package managers like Yarn and pnpm have emerged. Yarn is known for its speed, while pnpm optimizes disk space by sharing dependencies.

## What is Corepack?

[Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) is a new experimental feature in Node.js that allows you to manage the versions of package managers on your machines and environments. This means that all team members will use the same version of the package manager, which can help avoid compatibility issues.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.5.1" // what is this? (Corepack)
}
```

### Getting Started with Corepack

To enable Corepack, you can run the following command:

```shell
corepack enable
```

Once Corepack is enabled, to set your projectâ€™s package manager, run `corepack use`. This command updates your `package.json` automatically.

```shell
corepack use pnpm@8.x # sets the latest 8.x pnpm version in the package.json
corepack use yarn@* # sets the latest Yarn version in the package.json
```

### Why Use Corepack?

Corepack can help you avoid compatibility issues by ensuring that all team members use the same version of the package manager. It can also help you manage package manager versions across different environments, such as development, production, and testing.

### The Future of Corepack

Corepack represents a significant step forward in Node.js package management. By providing a unified interface for different package managers, it simplifies the development workflow and reduces the complexity associated with managing dependencies. As Corepack matures, it has the potential to become the standard way to manage Node.js packages.

Some points you should pay attention to for this year 2024 that will surely have a high impact on the technological ecosystem.

1. **Bun achieves its goal of becoming the default frontend runtime:** They still have some hurdles to overcome, but if they manage to provide a drop-in replacement for Node that instantly improves your application's performance 10x, it will be an obvious choice for most developers. The v1.0 release last September was a major step towards overall Windows compatibility and stability, and the bet is that Bun will start becoming the default choice this year.

2. **AI will replace no-code/low-code tools:** It turns out that AI is much better and faster at creating marketing analytics dashboards. Tools like [Basedash](https://www.basedash.com/) and [8base](https://archie.8base.com/) already use AI to create a full set of requirements, custom internal tools, and others will emerge to replace drag-and-drop builders to create sites that don't rely heavily on business logic.

3. **Netlify is acquired by GoDaddy:** With multiple rounds of layoffs, 2023 was clearly not the best year for Netlify. But sometimes the best way to recover is to find a new ~~sugar daddy~~, GoDaddy. After retiring the Media Temple brand a few months ago, it looks like GoDaddy might be back in the acquisition market for a platform like Netlify.

Any other ones you can think of? Help me update this post!!

Some points you should pay attention to for this year 2022 that will surely have a high impact on the technology ecosystem.

1. **RIP Babel and Webpack**: They will not disappear forever, but will be largely replaced by new compiler tools that are faster and more intuitive, such as [SWC](https://swc.rs/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

2. **Serverless will help frontend developers become (real) fullstack developers:** and (hopefully) get paid accordingly. Much of the serverless technology is based on V8 and is adopting Web APIs, so frontend developers will already be familiar with the key parts of the serverless infrastructure. Now, instead of starting up an Express server and calling yourself a ‚Äúfullstack developer‚Äù, Serverless will allow you to actually be one.

3. **Next.js will become less of a React meta-framework and more of a _web_ meta-framework**: Vercel has already hired Rich Harris (aka Lord of the Svelte) and has shared their plans for an [edge-first](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) approach to the web with any framework. They will lean even more on this in 2022, adapt to more JS frameworks/libs (with pillowcases full of cash) and prepare for an [IPO](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oferta_p%C3%BAblica_de_venta).

4. **[No/Low-code tools](https://www.genbeta.com/desarrollo/que-programacion-low-code-no-code-que-se-diferencian-como-estan-democratizando-creacion-aplicaciones) will dominate even more**: We will probably continue to ignore them; meanwhile, more agencies and teenagers will make millions of dollars submitting sites without writing a line of code. In 2022, we'll also start to see more established software companies with ‚Äúreal developers‚Äù leveraging no-code or low-code tools because the best code is the code you don't have to maintain.

5. **Meta will cede control of React**: Just like when they created [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation/) in 2018, Meta will create a React Foundation later this year and cede control of React. Unlike Microsoft/Amazon/Google, Meta has never (successfully) monetized developers, so React is not a strategic priority for the company. That might be even more true now, with Zuck's eyes on Metaverse and Sebastian Markb√•ge [leaving for Vercel](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1470761450541142023).

6. **VC will solve Open Source funding**: At least, it will feel that way. With some pre-revenue/traction/pmf OSS projects generating seed rounds at valuations between $25-50MM, you'll want to dust off that old side project of yours. I don't know if it's sustainable (it's not), but it's a lot better than when we relied on [Patreon](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/970722976739086336) to fund our critical web infrastructure.

7. **Netlify to acquire Remix**: Bottoms up framework is the wave. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will want the distribution and [Remix](https://remix.run/) will want the... money. It would allow the Remix team to spend their time on what they are good at, Remix-the-framework, rather than Remix-the-business. The pairing would give them both a much better chance of catching up with Vercel/Next.js.

While all that is going on ...? we can continue to work quietly.
